## Project Overview
- First of all you need to do this steps

pip install -r requirements.txt

The challenge of handling imbalanced datasets in multi-label classification scenarios is a significant hurdle in machine learning, particularly in domains where the imbalance reflects critical disparities in the data, such as medical diagnoses, text categorization, and image recognition. Our project aims to address this challenge by developing and implementing boosting algorithms tailored for multi-label imbalanced datasets. By enhancing the performance of classifiers in these complex scenarios, we strive to contribute towards more equitable and accurate predictive models.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to research, develop, and evaluate boosting approaches specifically designed to improve the handling of multi-label datasets with significant class imbalances. Our goals include:
- Investigating the limitations of current methodologies in dealing with multi-label imbalanced data.
- Proposing and implementing novel boosting techniques that can effectively manage the class imbalance problem.
- Comparing the effectiveness of our approaches against existing methods using a range of metrics that consider both accuracy and fairness.

## Methodology

Our methodology encompasses several key steps, tailored to address the unique challenges posed by multi-label imbalanced data:
- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Selection of diverse, real-world datasets that exhibit multi-label characteristics with varying degrees of imbalance. Preprocessing steps will be applied to prepare the data for analysis, including balancing techniques.
- **Algorithm Development**: Designing new boosting algorithms or modifying existing ones to better account for the distribution of labels in imbalanced datasets. This includes the development of sampling strategies, cost-sensitive learning techniques, and mechanisms to prioritize minority classes without compromising overall accuracy.
- **Evaluation Framework**: Establishing a comprehensive evaluation framework that includes traditional performance metrics (such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, MMCC score, MCC score, G-mean) as well as measures specifically designed to assess performance in imbalanced and multi-label contexts (such as the macro and micro-averaged versions of these metrics).
- **Benchmarking and Analysis**: Conducting extensive experiments to benchmark the performance of our proposed methods against current state-of-the-art approaches. This includes statistical analysis to validate the significance of our findings.
